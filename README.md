# CodeHunt C++ Framework

## Description

A framework based on the python implementation of the ML course's second
homework.

Implement your neural network in NeuralNetwork.h or derive the
NeuralNetwork class and implement its virtual methods.

## Usage

### Build

```
make build
```

### Run

Running all the test with
```
make
```
will also generate .png files representing the iteration-error plot for
each test.

You can also run a certain test with
```
./test <test_no>
```
or
```
make ARGS=<test_no>
```
